Aloha! I'm Tong, a first-year Ph.D. student in the Department of Computer Science at [Virginia Tech](https://www.vt.edu/).I am pursuing my doctorate under the advisement of Prof. [Yan Chen](https://chensivan.github.io/), researching Human-Computer Interaction, Human-AI Interaction and Intelligent Interactive. My current focus is on continuous AI and AI assistant technologies to better aid real-world tasks. I am passionate about leveraging AI to enhance human-computer collaboration.

Before joining Virginia Tech, I obtained my M.S. in Information Systems from [Washington University in St. Louis](https://wustl.edu/), and B.S. with double majors in Computer Science and Finance from China Agricultural University in Beijing, China.

Outside of academics, I enjoy photography and vlogging about my travels and road trips. I am passionate about the open road, having driven along Route 1 in California and Route A1A in Florida. Immersing myself in new scenery informs my understanding on life. I aspire to visit every national park in the US someday.
