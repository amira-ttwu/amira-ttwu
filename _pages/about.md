Aloha! I'm Tong, a first-year PhD student at [Virginia Tech](https://www.vt.edu/) in the department of Computer Science, advised by Prof. [Yan Chen](https://chensivan.github.io/).

I am interested in Human-computer Interaction and Artificial Intelligence. I explore how we can using AI techniques to better assist with real-world tasks.
