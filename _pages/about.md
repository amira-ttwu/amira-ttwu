Aloha! I'm Tong, a Ph.D. student in the Department of Computer Science at [Virginia Tech](https://www.vt.edu/). I am pursuing my doctorate under the advisement of Dr. [Hoda Eldardiry](https://people.cs.vt.edu/hdardiry/), researching machine learning, inforamtion extraction and Human-AI collaboration. My current focus is on applying machine learning to solve real-world challenges. 

Before joining Virginia Tech, I obtained my M.S. in Information Systems from [Washington University in St. Louis](https://wustl.edu/), and B.S. with double majors in Computer Science and Finance from China Agricultural University in Beijing, China.

Outside of academics, I enjoy photography and vlogging about my travels and road trips. I am passionate about the open road and new adventure. Immersing myself in new scenery informs my understanding on life. I aspire to visit every national park in the US someday.
